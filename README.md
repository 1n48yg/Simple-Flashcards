# Simple Flashcards

## Project Description

My project is a lightweight and convenient flashcard software
that users can use to quickly design small memorization tests
for themselves on any subject. The application will consist
of a user-defined **set** of **cards,** each of which contains
a question and an answer.

I designed this program due to its potential usefulness to
myself for studying concepts and vocabulary involved in my
geography class. There are obviously other similar programs
online, but many require paid subscriptions or arguably
intrusive information to sign up, have complex
UIs, require an internet connection, and are overall not very
lightweight.

The project was created using IntelliJ IDEA with 1.8-amazon-corretto JDK,
and it is recommended to build the project using these tools.
